    excerpt: "One question frequently asked by our users is how do they decide which suite to use. Some users will look at the version number and assume the latest is the greatest, but this is not always the case. Because of this confusion with the version issue, the ODK 2 suite of tools will be renamed in the near future. **The ODK 2 suite was designed to co-exist with ODK 1 tools, and does not replace any ODK 1 software.** <br /><br />In general, ODK 1 tools are easier to use, require less setup, and are widely adopted. However, if you have a complex longitudinal study and possess some technical skills, then ODK 2 software may be better suited to your needs. **We suggest starting with the [ODK 1 Suite](/software/odk1/) and if it does not fulfill the requirements of your desired usage scenario, then move on to the more advanced [ODK 2.0 Suite](/software/odk2/).**"
