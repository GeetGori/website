  Open Data Kit (ODK) is a collection of free and open-source software tools that aspire to help people achive more, better and faster, through mobile technology.

  The widely adopted ODK1 Family helps organizations author, collect, and manage mobile data collection solutions. In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images, ODK is being used to create decision support for clinicians and for building multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for many needs.

<h2>How we do it</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">We welcome and encourage participation from our users around the world! ODK is supported by a growing community of developers, implementers, and users -- as well as various organizations. Core ODK development is supported by ongoing research at the University of Washington's Department of Computer Science & Engineering (UW-CSE), and through donations from users.</p>

<p class="usa-font-lead">ODK project governance is currently being transitioned from a UW-CSE project to a community supported and controlled project. More information can be found on this website.</p>
